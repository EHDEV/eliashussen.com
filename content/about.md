I started my tech career in Ethiopia when I was hired as a Software Test Engineer at a startup in Addis Ababa. A year later I moved to the US to continue my education in software engineering. I completed my bachelors in Information Systems from CUNY Baruch and began working as a data warehouse / production support engineer. Later on I continued my career in tech as a senior data engineer at a number of companies in tech, media and finance.

I am currently working on starting up a company called Elite Data Labs, that builds AI applications, consults and trains professionals in Machine Learning and Data Engineering. 

I’m also building a text analytics api api.xitext.com that will be under the company, Elite Data Labs. The api will enable anyone to send a piece of text and get the text classified for sentiment, topic, etc and will extract named entities, key phrases, etc

I have built and worked on a number of advanced data projects from simple ETL applications to advanced Machine Learning pipelines. 
- Lead prospect prediction api
- Topic classification model for VICE Media news articles
- VICE Media’s Data Warehouse and ETL Pipelines
