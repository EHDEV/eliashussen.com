Born and raised in  Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, I've been living in New York since 2004. I studied at CUNY Baruch for my Bachelors then Columbia University for my Masters in Data Science. 

I am a well experienced Data Engineer with strong Machine Learning skills and experience making me a unique candidate for Data Analytics teams. 

I am currently working on a text classification and extraction SaaS platform that I hope to complete in the next three months. I am using Huggingface transformers pretrained models for the text extraction, summarization and classification use cases applied to a number of prominent industries.

I do some consulting on the side as well as  trainings, speaking engagements, seminars and volunteer work at educational and for-profit instititutions. 

Feel free to reach out if I can help you professionally or you need my assistance on worthy causes.
