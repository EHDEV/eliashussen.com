#### _Steps I took in building an end-to-end Deep Learning pipeline for Text Classification_ 

### Introduction


Thou I had built something similar while I was working as a Senior Data Engineerat VICE, I only built the training and serving pipelines and handed them to our DevOps team to deploy them. 

This time I built the models, the training pipeline, the serving script and deployed them to production.
