Data Engineering the process of collecting, transforming, warehousing and analyzing of all kinds of datasets from disparate sources. A DE is responsible for building data integration pipelines; data warehouses and data lakes as well as visualizations and dashboards that report on the data.

I found  GitLab data team's definition  of a Data Engineer as relatively simple and straight to the point 

> Data Engineers are essentially software engineers who have a particular focus on the movement and orchestration of data.

Though the above is mostly true, one key difference  is that a data engineer often has to deal with adhoc data integration requests, requiring quick and dirty scripts that often find themselves deployed to production. The data requests often come in at the last minute with clients needing the data yesterday. It can be frustrating. 

## Why Data Engineering can be challenging?

Here are some more that Data Engineers may encounter in their career

- The frequently changing nature of source schema makes it challenging to build code that is adaptable to the data with changed schema. 
- There is so much valuable data to collect, warehouse and analyze in shorter and shorter cadences that any interruption due to a bug or other reasons would mean chaos and panic by the end-users of the data. So the engineer frequently finds herself fixing bugs in data pipelines that are deployed in production and then manually trigger backfills.
- Data sources are often restrictive of how much and how often one can pull data from them so a data engineer would often find herself spending too much time on the challenging task of devising hacks to get over throttling and api request limits

## How is Data Engineering rewarding?
 
With that being said, a Data Engineer is rewarded with a lot in her career including with the following:

- she is among the most Essential Workers at data centric organizations, ensuring that she will be among the highly paid; the last to be laid off; and is always in demand in the job market.
- The data engineer, serving the entire companyâ€™s needs for data and analytics, will have the opportunity to work with important teams and executives within the company enjoying great visibility and influence.
- An opportunity to learn and work with some of the best tools and technologies in the cloud like AWS, Google Cloud, Snowflake, Facebook  API, Twitter API, etc. 
- The work of a Data Engineer is very well suited to work from home

Despite the challenges that can be frustrating at times, the data engineering profession is highly rewarding financially and in job satisfaction. A data engineer, among the most important roles within an organization, is highly in demand and is highly paid. Try it :-)
